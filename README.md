# Jobs

This is a open source project that demonstrates using Anguler 4 and TypeScript as front end technology.
This application makes simple posting and searching every day jobs. Also this application connects employees and employers.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

if it's not already installed on your machine.

**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
gulp build
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application,
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

### npm scripts

Useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run lite` - runs the lite-server, a light-weight, static file server.
