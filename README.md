# Jobs

This is a open source project that demonstrates using Anguler 2 and TypeScript as front end technology.
This application makes simple posting and searching every day jobs. Also this application connects employees and employers.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.

if it's not already installed on your machine.

**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application,
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.

### npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run tsc` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run tsc:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run lite` - runs the [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by
[John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and
[Christopher Martin](https://github.com/cgmartin)
with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.

Here are the test related scripts:
* `npm test` - compiles, runs and watches the karma unit tests
* `npm run e2e` - run protractor e2e tests, written in JavaScript (*e2e-spec.js)

## Testing

The QuickStart documentation doesn't discuss testing.
This repo adds both karma/jasmine unit test and protractor end-to-end testing support.

These tools are configured for specific conventions described below.

*It is unwise and rarely possible to run the application, the unit tests, and the e2e tests at the same time.
We recommend that you shut down one before starting another.*

### Unit Tests
TypeScript unit-tests are usually in the `app` folder. Their filenames must end in `.spec`.

Look for the example `app/app.component.spec.ts`.
Add more `.spec.ts` files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.

Run it with `npm test`

That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma test-runner.
Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

Test-runner output appears in the terminal window.
We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.
Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down (`Ctrl-C`) and
restart it. No worries; it's pretty quick.
